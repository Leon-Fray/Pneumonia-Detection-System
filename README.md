# AI Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-rays

Pneumonia Detection

This repository contains a deep learning model for automatic pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images. The model utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify pneumonia cases from a dataset of chest X-ray images. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an efficient tool for preliminary pneumonia screening.



Pneumonia is a common and life-threatening illness that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images is crucial for timely and effective medical intervention. This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence to automate the pneumonia detection process, providing a rapid and reliable solution for healthcare professionals.

Model Architecture

The pneumonia detection model is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network, specifically designed for image classification tasks. Transfer learning techniques are employed to fine-tune the model for pneumonia detection using the dataset.

Dataset

The pneumonia detection model is trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains X-ray images classified into two classes: normal and pneumonia.

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in pneumonia detection.
